## üéØ Project Scope

**Important Note**: This project focuses on database design and management system architecture. The system provides:

- **Database Schema**: Comprehensive relational database design for agricultural data management
- **Data Storage**: Structured storage for crops, diseases, pesticides, irrigation, weather, and yield data
- **Query System**: Stored procedures for data retrieval and basic analysis
- **Framework**: Foundation for future implementation of predictive analytics and machine learning models

**What this project does NOT include**:
- Machine learning algorithms for disease prediction
- Real-time sensor data integration
- Advanced predictive analytics
- Trained models with actual agricultural data

The stored procedures provide basic conditional logic and data retrieval, not predictive modeling. This system serves as a foundation that can be extended with actual predictive capabilities in future development phases.

### Key Problems Solved
- **Disease Outbreaks**: Predict and manage disease outbreaks that cause significant yield losses globally

- **Disease-Pesticide**: Many-to-Many (Diseases can be treated by multiple pesticides)
- **Crop-IrrigationSchedule**: One-to-One (Each crop has one irrigation schedule)
- **Disease-Weather**: Many-to-Many (Weather conditions influence multiple diseases)
- **Pesticide-YieldInfo**: One-to-Many (Pesticides impact yield)
- **Irrigation-YieldInfo**: One-to-Many (Irrigation schedules affect yield)

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- MySQL Server (version 8.0 or higher)
- MySQL Workbench (optional, for GUI management)

### Database Setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Puneeth0106/crop-disease-management-system.git
cd crop-disease-management-system
```

2. Import the database schema:
```bash
mysql -u root -p < database/schema.sql
```

3. Insert sample data (optional):
```bash
mysql -u root -p < database/sample_data.sql
```

## üìä Usage

### Basic Operations

#### Adding a New Crop
```sql
INSERT INTO Crop (Type, PlantingDate, DiseaseResistanceLevel, AverageYield)
VALUES ('Wheat', '2024-03-15', 'High', 2500);
```

#### Checking Disease Alerts
```sql
CALL GetDiseaseAlert('Wheat', 25, 80, 150);
```

#### Getting Pesticide Recommendations
```sql
CALL RecommendPesticide('Blight');
```

## üîß Stored Procedures

### 1. Disease Alert System
**Procedure**: `GetDiseaseAlert`
- **Parameters**: Crop type, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
- **Returns**: Diseases that match current weather conditions (basic conditional logic)
- **Note**: Uses simple threshold-based matching, not predictive modeling

### 2. Yield Estimation
**Procedure**: `PredictYield`
- **Parameters**: Crop type, Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall
- **Returns**: Basic yield estimation using simple multiplication factors
- **Note**: Uses basic conditional logic, not machine learning prediction

### 3. Pesticide Recommendation
**Procedure**: `RecommendPesticide`
- **Parameters**: Disease type
- **Returns**: Recommended pesticides based on disease-pesticide relationships
- **Note**: Database lookup, not intelligent recommendation system
